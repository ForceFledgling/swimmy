```bash
git clone https://github.com/pvenv/swimmy.git
```

**Step 2:** Create a .env file in the project's root directory and add the following variables.

* Note: you can use secret library to generate jwt_secret
```python
from secrets import token_urlsafe
token_urlsafe(32)
```
* Example for .env file:
```bash
#FASTAPI
SERVER_PORT='8000'
JWT_SECRET='123456789zxcvbnm'

#POSTGRESQL
POSTGRES_HOST='swimmy-db'
POSTGRES_DB='swimmy'
POSTGRES_USER='root'
POSTGRES_PASSWORD='toor'
```

**Step 3:** Running and usage the project:
```bash
    cd swimmy  # root project dir
    docker-compose up -d
```

### ðŸŽ‰ Additionally:

* You can populate the example in the database with the script when starting this project.

```bash
    cd swimmy  # root project dir
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.data.yml up --build --force-recreate --no-deps -d
```
or run the script manually, inside the container
```bash
    root@c1788b7d6f1c:/fastapi# python example_data.py
```
